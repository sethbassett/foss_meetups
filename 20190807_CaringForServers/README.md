# FOSS_Server_Presentation
This is the PDF version of the FOSS Server presentation, "Feeding, Watering, and Caring for GIS Servers". This repository also contains a text document that has the steps needed to do an initial setup, create user, configure and enable firewall, learn basic apt (advanced packaging tool) operations for managing software, install and do one configuration on Apache Web Server, and disable root log in.  This results in a base Ubuntu web server that can be extended to include other FOSS spatial software like PostgreSQL and MapServer, as well as system management utilities like logwatch, and email. Please keep in mind that this is a base install, but as you proceed you'll need to implement other security details for both the operating system, and any additional packages you install. These commands have been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
